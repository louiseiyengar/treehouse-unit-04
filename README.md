# FSJS project 4 - The Book Title Hunter

For this OOJS project, I created a word game in which you need to guess the letters of a book title -- generally a well known American or English novel or play.

You guess the letters by typing a letter on your keyboard or clicking the buttons on an on-screen keyboard.

You have five tries - each incorrect guess will lose you one heart.  

In addition, I added a feature allowing you to see the author of the book, but it will cost one heart (try).  On your fourth wrong guess, the option to see the author will disappear.

After five wrong guesses, or if you correctly select all the letters in the title, you will see a screen indicating whether you won or lost, and displaying the book's title and author.
